 Recent years have seen a great deal of experimentation around the basic
 concept of the journal. This chapter overviews some of the more novel or
 interesting developments in this space, developments which include new
 business models; new editorial models, and new ways in which the traditional
 functions of the journal can be disaggregated into separate services.

## Introduction

For a long period following the invention of the Academic Journal in the
17th Century, the journal evolved very little, and certainly did not
change substantially from the original format. It was perhaps with the
formalization of the Peer Review process (as we have come to know it)
that the concept of the journal made its greatest leap. Other than that
development, very little changed in over 300 years...

However, since the advent of the internet, the ‘traditional’ concept of
the Academic Journal has been under pressure. Although subscription
titles moved online quite early in the internet era, it has only been
with the more recent, and still accelerating, move towards Open Access
(an innovation which was made possible thanks to the enabling technology
of the internet) that there has been a considerable amount of
experimentation around what a journal is, or could be.

Because of the size of this industry and the scale of experimentation
which is underway, the examples listed in this chapter are not intended
to represent a comprehensive list, but simply to highlight some of the
representative experiments that are happening today.

## Novelty in the Business Model

Clearly the predominant business model in journal publishing has always
been the subscription model, however there have been several recent
developments which aim to provide alternatives to this established
model. The most obvious alternative in today’s marketplace is the Open
Access ‘author pays’ APC (Article Publication Charge) model which has
been successfully used by the likes of BioMed Central, PLOS, Hindawi,
and Frontiers, to name a few. This model will be well understood by most
readers, so we shall not dwell on it here. Instead it is interesting to
consider some of the other Open Access business models which are in the
marketplace today:

### Free to Publish
[eLife](http://www.elifesciences.org/the-journal/) is
a highly selective, open access journal which is entirely financed by
research funders (Max Planck Society, the, Wellcome Trust and the HHMI).
Because of this funding, the journal does not charge authors a
publication fee (hence it is free to publish, as well as free to read).
eLife is perhaps the most recent, and visible, example of a ‘free-free’
journal but clearly many other journals are funded by entities such as
Institutions, or Societies to the extent that their costs can also be
entirely covered.

### Individual Membership Models
[PeerJ](https://peerj.com/)[^1] (see Fig. 1) is an open access journal which offers authors a Lifetime
Membership, in return for which authors can publish freely for life.
Membership fees start at $99 (allowing authors to publish once per
year) and rise to $299 (which allows authors to freely publish as many
articles as they wish). All co-authors need to be paying members with
the correct Membership level. Membership fees can be paid either before
editorial Acceptance; or authors can submit for free and become a Member
only at the time of Editorial Acceptance (for a slight price increase).
This model is very new, and clearly orthogonal to a traditional APC fee
(as it shifts payment from a “fee per publication” to a “fee per
author”) - therefore it is being watched with some interest, to see how
the model might affect the approach of the publisher towards its
‘customers’ (who are now Members).

### APC Fees Centrally Negotiated
[SCOAP](http://scoap3.org/about.html)[3](http://scoap3.org/about.html)
(the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle
Physics) has been a multi year project by a consortium of high energy
physics laboratories aiming to flip their entire field from a
subscription basis to open access. SCOAP3 has raised committed funding
from major libraries and research centers worldwide such that it has
been able to take that commitment and approach the publishers of the
main subscription titles in their field, requesting that they tender for
the Open Access business of the community. The arrangement comes along
with a promise that committed institutions will no longer subscribe to
journals, but will instead fund the open access fees of the researchers
in the field.

## Novelty in the Editorial Model

For a very long period there was no formal peer review process in the
sciences and as recently as the 1970s, many journals did not formally
peer review everything they published. However, since that time, the
process of peer review has become firmly intertwined with the concept of
the scholarly journal. The peer review which has evolved in this way has
largely tried to do two things at the same time: (i) to comment on the
validity of the science, and suggest ways in which it could be improved;
and (ii) to comment on the interest level (or ‘impact’) of that science,
in an attempt to provide a sorting, or filtering mechanism on the mass
of submitted content. However, with the advent of the internet; the
development of online only ‘author pays’ business models; and the
development of improved methods of search and discovery, this second
aspect of peer review has become increasingly less important.

It was in this environment that
[PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/)
[(from the Public Library of Science](http://www.plos.org/))
was conceived *(\* Disclosure - the author of this chapter previously
ran PLOS ONE)* - a journal which would peer review all content, but only
ask the reviewers to comment on the scientific and methodological
soundness, not on the level of interest (or ‘impact’, or ‘degree of
advance’) of the article. PLOS ONE has proven to be wildly successful -
it launched in December 2006, and in 2012 alone it published [23,464
articles](http://www.plosone.org/search/advanced?pageSize=12&sort=&queryField=publication\_date&startDateAsString=2012-01-01&endDateAsString=2012-12-31&unformattedQuery=publication\_date%3A[2012-01-01T00%3A00%3A00Z+TO+2012-12-31T23%3A59%3A59Z]+&journalOpt=some&filterJournals=PLoSONE&subjectCatOpt=all&filterArticleTypeOpt=all) (approximately 2.5% of all the content indexed by PubMed in
that year, and making it the largest journal in the world by several
multiples) and continues to grow year on year. This success did not go
unnoticed - PLOS ONE coined a new category of journal, the “Open Access
Megajournal” and, with it, gave rise to a number of similar journals
(employing similar editorial criteria).

The archetypal features of a MegaJournal seem to be:

1. editorial criteria which judges articles only on scientific soundness;
2. a very broad subject scope (for example the whole of Genetics, the whole of
Social Sciences);
3. an open access model employing a payment model (typically APC) which is set up for each article to pay its own costs;
4. a large editorial board of academic editors (as opposed to a staff of
professional editors).

Although some megajournals are not completely transparent about their
editorial criteria (perhaps for fear of harming their brand), a
non-exhaustive list of these ‘MegaJournals’ would currently include (in
no particular order)

* [BMJ Open](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/)
* [SAGE Open](http://sgo.sagepub.com/)
* [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/)
* [Springer Plus](http://www.springerplus.com/)
* [Scientific Reports (from Nature)](http://www.nature.com/srep/index.html)
* [Q Science Connect](http://www.qscience.com/loi/connect)
* [Elementa](http://elementascience.org/)
* [Optics Express](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/home.cfm)
* [G3 (from the Genetics Society of America)](http://www.g3journal.org/)
* [Biology Open (from the Company of Biologists)](http://bio.biologists.org/)
* [IEEE Access](http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/ieee_access.html)
* [AIP Advances](http://aipadvances.aip.org/about/journal)
* [The Scientific World Journal](http://www.tswj.com/)
* [Cureus](http://www.cureus.com/)
* [F1000 Research](http://f1000research.com/)
* [FEBS Open Bio](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/febs-open-bio/)

In addition, it has been argued that the
[BMC Series](http://www.biomedcentral.com/authors/bmcseries), the
[“Frontiers in…" Series](http://www.frontiersin.org/about/evaluationsystem), and the [ISRN
Series from Hindawi](http://www.hindawi.com/isrn) (all of which apply similar
editorial criteria, but attempt to retain subject-specific identity to
each journal in their Series) should also be considered megajournals,
although they typically seem to downplay that association.

## Novelty in the Peer Review Model

Although the megajournals have successfully implemented a single change
to the peer review process (not judging based on impact), there are
other innovators who have journals (or ‘journal-like’) products which
are trying other variations with their peer review. Some illustrative
examples are:

Hindawi’s ISRN Series algorithmically identifies suitable peer reviewers
(mainly from its pool of Editorial Board members), and then operates an
anonymous peer review process which culminates in a ‘vote’ between the
peer reviewers. If all peer reviewers are in agreement to either accept
or reject the article then it is accepted or rejected. However, if there
is any disagreement as to the decision, then the reviews are shown to
all the peer reviewers and they are invited to change their opinion.
After this second round, the decision goes with the majority opinion
(even if not unanimous). Once accepted, the authors are given the option
of voluntarily revising their manuscript based on the feedback. This
process is described, for example, at [Hindawi’s Website](http://www.hindawi.com/isrn/obgyn/workflow/).

By contrast,
[F1000 Research](http://f1000research.com/)
receives submissions and places them publicly online before peer review.
Reviews are then solicited (typically from the Editorial Board) and
reviewers must sign their reports. The reports can be ‘approved’,
‘approved with reservations’, or ‘not approved’ (Fig 2). Provided an article accrues at least one
‘approved’ and two ‘approved with reservations’ (or simply two
‘approved’ reports) then it is considered to be ‘published’ and
subsequently it is indexed in PubMed Central, and Scopus. Authors are
not obliged to revise their manuscripts in light of feedback. Because
content is posted online even before peer review has started, F1000
Research is thus composed of content in varying states of peer review,
and as such can be thought of as a cross between a journal and a
preprint server.

![**Figure 2**. The article listing for F1000 Research, highlighting the way
that evaluations are presented.](/images/novel_scholarly_journal_concepts_2.jpg)

The [PLoS Currents series](http://currents.plos.org) of 6 titles can also be thought of as
a cross between a journal and a preprint server. There is no publication
fee and any content posted to a PLOS Current is submitted using an
authoring tool which automatically generates XML. The content is
evaluated by an editorial board, and these boards typically look to make
very rapid decisions as to whether or not to publish the content (they
are not typically recommending revisions or performing a full peer
review). Because of this process, articles can go online within a day or
two of submission, and are then indexed by PubMed Central. Although an
interesting concept, to date PLOS Currents have not received a large
number of submissions.

And then, of course there are the true ‘*PrePrint Servers*’. Two
defining features of the preprint server are that (i) the content is
typically un-peer reviewed, and (ii) they are usually free (gratis) to
submit to. Because a preprint server is rarely thought of as a ‘journal’
(and this chapter is devoted to innovations around the journal concept)
we shall not spend much time on them, other than to provide an
illustrative list which includes the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) (in
Physics and Mathematics),
[PeerJ Preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints) (in the Bio and Medical sciences),
[Nature Preceedings](http://precedings.nature.com/)
(now defunct), [FigShare](http://figshare.com/) (a product which is
‘preprint-like’, and covering all of academia); the
[Social Sciences Research Network (SSRN)](http://www.ssrn.com/)
and [Research Papers in Economics (RePEc)](http://repec.org/).

## The Disaggregation of the Journal Model

Historically, a journal has performed several functions such as
‘archiving’, ‘registration’, ‘dissemination’, and ‘certification’ (there
are others, but these four have historically defined the journal).
However it is increasingly evident that these functions do not need to
all take place within a single journal ‘container’ – instead each
function can be broken off and handled by separate entities.

Several interesting companies are arising to take advantage of this way
of thinking. Although each service can be thought of as an attempt to
‘disaggregate’ the journal, they are also being used by existing
journals to to enhance and extend their features and functionality. As
with preprint servers, none of these products are really thought of as a
journal, but it is certainly useful to be aware of them when considering
the future development of the journal model:

[Rubriq](http://www.rubriq.com/) is a company which attempts to provide
“3^rd^ party peer review” – authors submit to Rubriq and they then
solicit (and pay) appropriate peer reviewers to provide structures
reports back to the author. Another example of this kind of thinking is
with the
[Peerage of Science](http://www.peerageofscience.org/). By using services like
this, authors can either improve their articles before then submitting
to a journal; or they can attempt to provide their solicited peer
reviews to the journal of their choice in the hope that this will
shorten their review process. *(\* Disclosure - the author of this
chapter is on the (unpaid) Advisory Panel of Rubriq)*

![**Figure 3**. The Peerage of Science homepage.](/images/novel_scholarly_journal_concepts_3.jpg)

‘[Altmetrics](http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/)’, or ‘[Article-Level Metrics](http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/)’ (ALM) are tools which aim
to provide 3rd party ‘crowdsourced’ evaluation of published articles (or
other scholarly content). If we envision a future state of the
publishing industry where most content is open access, and a large
proportion of it has been published by a megajournal, then it is clear
that there are considerable opportunities for services which can direct
readers to the most relevant, impactful, or valuable content for their
specific needs. Pioneered by the likes of PLOS[^6] (who made their ALM
program entirely open source), the field is being pushed forward by
newly started companies. The major players in this space are
[ImpactStory](http://impactstory.org/)
(previously Total Impact), [Altmetric](http://www.altmetric.com/) and
[Plum Analytics](http://www.plumanalytics.com/)
and all of them attempt to collate a variety of alt-metrics from many
different sources, and present them back again at the level of the
article (Fig 4).

![**Figure 4**. The Impact Story homepage, highlighting which sources they index and how they present metrics for a single article.](/images/novel_scholarly_journal_concepts_4.jpg)

One particularly interesting provider of ‘alt metrics’ is
[F1000Prime](http://f1000.com/prime) (from the “Faculty of 1000”). Previously
known simply as ‘Faculty of 1000’, F1000Prime makes use of a very large
board of expert academics who are asked to evaluate and rate published
articles regardless of the publisher. In this way, they form an
independent review board which attempts to direct readers towards the
articles of most significance. Although F1000Prime only evaluates
perhaps 2% of the literature (and hence is not comprehensive), it is
clear that an approach like this fits well with a concept of
disaggregating the role of ‘content evaluation’ (or ‘content filtering’)
from the journal process.

## Conclusion

As can be seen from this chapter, there is a great deal of
experimentation happening in the journal space today. It remains to be
seen which experiments will succeed and which will fail, but it is
certainly the case that the last decade has seen more experimentation
around the concept of the journal than its entire 350 year history prior
to this point. We live in interesting times.
