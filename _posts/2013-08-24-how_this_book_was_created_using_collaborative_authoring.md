 This book about novel publishing and collaboration methods of scholarly
 knowledge was itself created using novel and collaborative authoring tools.
 Google Docs as a collaborative authoring and text editing tool and Dropbox as
 a cloud storage solution were used. Our experience was a positive one and we
 think that it saved us a lot of organisational emails and hundreds of work
 hours. Here we describe the workflow process in detail so that the interested
 author might benefit from what we learnt.

## How This Book was Created

The creation process can be divided in several phases in regard to the
online tools which were used.

**Phase I:** Potential content was collected and authors were invited to
participate. Shortly afterwards, a table in Google Docs was
collaboratively maintained by both editors. For each chapter, the title
and possible authors were discussed, emails to authors were sent, and
feedback was added. Chapters were divided among both editors, so that
one contact person was responsible for each chapter. In jour-fixe Skype
sessions the status of the work in progress was discussed.

editors in the early phase of this book project.](/images/how_this_book_was_created.jpg)

**Phase II:** A table of contents was created as a text document in
Google Docs. The returning abstracts were uploaded to Google Docs and
the links were created to the abstracts. The table of contents file
served as the central document (Figure 1).

**Phase III:** Returning articles were uploaded to Google Docs and the
authors were invited to participate with ‘editing’ privileges. Articles
were also linked to the TOC. Authors and editors worked iteratively on
the Google documents. Commenting functionality was used to discuss
points of controversy. Images were designed in Apple Keynote and the
image files and other files were shared using Dropbox.

![**Figure 2**. During the editing process of the chapters, the authors and
editors changed the chapters with editing privileges, while all others
authors were invited to comment - serving as a form of internal
peer-review.](/images/how_this_book_was_created_2.jpg)

**Phase IV:** An internal review started once almost final versions of
the chapters existed. All authors received a TOC with links to every
chapter - all authors possessed commenting privileges for all other
chapters. Only the chapter authors and editors had the right to change
the text. The internal references within the book were set in this phase
and the consistency among the chapters was assured. Citations were added
using the Harvard author-date style, omitting the necessity of changing
in-text references if novel references were added. Since Google Docs
lacks integration with a reference management system, Zotero was used to
import the references from databases. The bibliographies for each
chapter were generated from shared Zotero databases (one for each
chapter) and manually inserted into the documents. URLs were included as
footnotes.

**Phase V:** After reviewing changes and undertaking final
proofreading, a finalized table of contents with embedded links was sent
to the publisher.

**Phase VI (now):** The book is now available as Open Access printed
book and its content can be downloaded from www.openingscience.org. Here
the content can also be edited.
