 This chapters outlines some of the principles ways United States Intellectual
 Property Law affects the sharing of digital scholarly objects, particularly
 for those who wish to practice reproducible computational science or open
 science. The sharing of the research manuscript, and the data and code that
 are associated with the manuscript, can be subject to copyright and software
 is potentially subject to patenting. Both of these aspects of Intellectual
 Property must be confronted by researchers and this is discussed for each of
 the three digital scholarly objects: the research article; the data; and the
 code. Recommendations are made to maximize the downstream reuse utility of
 each of these objects. Finally, this chapter proposes new structures to
 manage Intellectual Property rights related to scientific research going
 forward.

## Introduction

A deep digitization of the scientific enterprise is taking place across
the research landscape and generating new ways of understanding our
surroundings. As a result, our stock of scientific knowledge is now
accumulating in digital form. Our DNA is encoded as genome sequence
data, scans of brain activity exist in functional magnetic resonance
image databases, and records of our climate are stored in myriad time
series datasets—to name but a few examples. Equally as importantly, our
reasoning about these data is recorded in software, in the scripts and
code that analyze and make sense of our digitally recorded world.
Sharing the code and data that underlie scientific findings is a
necessary step to permit the transfer of knowledge embodied in the
results, such that they can be independently verified, re-used,
re-purposed, understood, and applied in new areas and to solve new
problems. The inability to access scientific data and code stands as a
barrier to the verification of scientific findings, and as a barrier to
the knowledge transfer needed to both facilitate scientific advancement
and spurn innovation and entrepreneurship around scientific findings.

These computational advances have taken place in parallel with the
development of the Internet as a pervasive digital communication
mechanism, creating an unprecedented opportunity to broaden access to
scientific understanding. But this notion of unmitigated access to
scientific knowledge largely remains an unrealized opportunity. In this
chapter I describe Intellectual Property barriers to the open sharing of
scientific knowledge, and motivate solutions that coincide with
longstanding scientific norms and actions. In Section 1, I frame
scientific communication as a narrative with a twofold purpose: to
communicate the importance of the results within the larger scientific
context and to provide sufficient information such that the findings may
be verified by others in the field. With the advent of digitization,
replication typically means supplying the data, software, and scripts,
including all parameter settings, that produced the results (King 1995;
Donoho et al. 2009). Included in this discussion is the importance of
access to the primary research narrative, the publication of the
results. Sections 2 and 3 then discuss Intellectual Property barriers
and solutions that enable data and code sharing respectively. Each of
these three research outputs, the research article, the data, and the
code, require different legal analyses in the scientific context.

## Research Dissemination: The Narrative

A typical empirical scientific workflow goes something like this: a
research experiment is designed to answer a question; data are
collected, filtered, and readied for analysis; models are fit,
hypotheses tested, and results interpreted; findings are written up in a
manuscript which is submitted for publication. Although highly
simplified, this vignette illustrates the integral nature of narrative,
data, and code in modern scientific research. What it does not show is
the limited nature of the research paper in communicating the many
details of a computational experiment and the need for data and code
disclosure. This is the subject of Sections 2 and 3. This section
motivates the sharing of the research paper, and discusses the clash
that has arisen between the need for scientific dissemination and modern
intellectual property law in the United States.

A widely accepted scientific norm, labeled by Robert K. Merton, is
*Communism* or *Communalism* (Merton 1973). With this Merton described
an ideal in scientific research, that property rights extend only to the
naming of scientific discoveries (Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem for
example, named for its originator Kenneth Arrow), and all other
intellectual property rights are given up in exchange for recognition
and esteem. This idea underpins the current system of publication and
citation that forms the basis for academic rewards and promotions.
Results are described in the research manuscript which is then
published, typically in established academic journals, and authors
derive credit through their publications and other contributions to the
research community. They do not receive financial or other material
rewards beyond recognition by peers of the value of their contributions.
There are many reasons for the relinquishment of property rights over
discoveries in science, but two stand out. It is of primary importance
to the integrity of our body of scientific knowledge that what is
recognized as scientific knowledge has as little error as possible.
Access not just to new discoveries, but also to the methods and
derivations of candidates for new knowledge, is imperative for
verification of these results and for determining their potential
admission as a scientific fact. The recognition that the scientific
research process is error prone—error can creep in at any time and in
any aspect of research, regardless of who is doing the work—is central
to the scientific method. The second reason Intellectual Property rights
have been historically eschewed in scientific research is the historical
understanding that scientific knowledge about our world, such as
physical laws, mathematical theorems, or the nature of biological
functions, is not subject to property rights but something belonging to
all of humanity. The U.S. federal government
granted [more than 50 billion dollars](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/budget_2012/)
for scientific research last year because of the vision that fundamental
knowledge about our world isn’t subject to ownership but is a public
good to be shared across all members of society[^1]. This
vision is also reflected both in the widespread understanding of
scientific facts as “discoveries” and not “inventions,” denoting their
preexisting nature. Further, current intellectual property law does not
recognize a scientific discovery as rising to the level of individual
ownership, unlike an invention or other contribution. Here, we focus on
the interaction of intellectual property law and scientific research
article dissemination.

Copyright law in the United States originates in the Constitution, when
it states that “The Congress shall have Power … To promote the Progress
of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and
Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and
Discoveries”.[^2] Through a series of laws and interpretations since
then, copyright has come to automatically assign a specific set of
rights to original expressions of ideas. In the context of scientific
research, this means that the written description of a finding is
copyright to the author(s) whether or not they wish it to be, and
similarly for code and data (discussed in the following two sections).
Copyright secures exclusive rights vested in the author to both
reproduce the work and prepare derivative works based upon the original.
There are exceptions and limitations to this power, such as Fair Use,
but none of these provides an intellectual property framework for
scientific knowledge that is concordant with current scientific practice
and the scientific norms described above. In fact far from it.

Current intellectual property law, and how this law is interpreted by
academic and research institutions, means that scientific authors
generally have copyright over their research manuscripts. Copyright can
be transferred, and in a system established many decades ago journals
that publish the research manuscripts typically request that copyright
be assigned to the publisher for free, rather than remain with the
authors, as a condition of publication. With some notable exceptions,
this is how academic publication continues today. Access to the
published articles requires asking permission of the publisher who owns
the copyright owner, and usually involves paying a fee. Typically
scientific journal articles are available only to the privileged few
affiliated with a university library that pays subscription fees, and
articles are otherwise offered for a surcharge of about $30 each.

A transformation is underway that has the potential to make scientific
knowledge openly and freely available, to everyone. The debate over
access to scientific publications breaks into two camps. On one side are
those who believe tax-payers should have access to the fruits of the
research they’ve funded, and on the other side are those who believe
that journal publishing is a business like any other,
and the free markets should therefore be left unfettered (see [Association of American Publishers Press Release](www.publishers.org/press/56)). The transformation started
in 1991 when Paul Ginsparg, Professor of Physics at Cornell University,
set up an open repository
called [Archive.org](http://arxiv.org/) (pronounced “archive”) for physics articles awaiting journal
publication. In the biosciences, a new publishing model was brought to
life in
2000—[open access publishing](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2011/11/plos-open-access-collection-–-resources-to-educate-and-advocate/)—through
the establishment of
the [Public Library of Science](http://www.plos.org/about/),
PLoS.[^3] PLoS publishes scientific articles by charging the authors the
costs upfront,
typically [about $2000 per article](http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/),
and making the published papers available on the web for free.[^4] The
PLoS model has been extraordinarily
successful,[gaining in prestige and publishing more articles](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2011/06/28/plos-ones-2010-impact-factor/)
today than any other scientific journal.[^5]

The U.S. government has joined in this movement toward openness in
scientific literature. In 2009 the National Institutes for Health (NIH)
began requiring all published articles arising from research it funds to
be placed in the publicly accessible
repository [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)[^6]
within 12 months of publication. In January of 2011, President Obama
signed
the [America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr5116enr/html/BILLS-111hr5116enr.htm)[^7].
This bill included two key sections that step toward the broad
implementation of open access mandates for scientific research. The Act
both required the establishment of an Interagency Public Access
Committee to coordinate dissemination of peer-reviewed scholarly
publications from research supported by Federal science agencies, and it
directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Whitehouse
to develop policies facilitating online access to unclassified Federal
scientific collections. As a result, on November 3, 2011 the Whitehouse
announced two public requests for information on,
“[Public Access to Peer-Reviewed Scholarly Publications Resulting From Federally Funded Research](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/11/04/2011-28623/request-for-information-public-access-to-peer-reviewed-scholarly-publications-resulting-from)”
and
“[Public Access to Digital Data Resulting From Federally Funded Scientific Research](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/11/04/2011-28621/request-for-information-public-access-to-digital-data-resulting-from-federally-funded-scientific)”,
and the responses are currently under Whitehouse review.[^8]

These events indicate increasing support for the public availability of
scientific publications on both the part of regulators and the
scientists who create the content.[^9] The paradoxical publishing
situation of sustained high charges for content generated (and
subsidized) for the public good came about in part through the
scientific norm of transparency. As mentioned earlier establishing a
scientific fact is difficult, error-prone work. The researcher must
convince skeptics that he or she has done everything possible to root
out error, and as such expose their methods to community scrutiny in
order to flush out any possible mistakes. Scientific publication is not
an exercise in *informing* others of new findings, it is an active
dialog designed to flush out error and maximize the integrity of the
knowledge. Scientific findings and their methodologies that are
communicated as widely as possible have the best chance of minimizing
error.

Scientific knowledge could be spread more widely, more mistakes caught,
and the rate of scientific progress improved. Scientists should keep
copyright over their published articles and share them more freely,
rather than remitting ownership to publishers. Many journals have a
second copyright agreement that permits the journals to publish the
article, but leaves copyright in the hands of the authors.[^10] We are in
need of a streamlined and uniform way of managing copyright over
scientific publications, and also copyright on data and code, as
elaborated in the next section.

## Research Dissemination: Data and “Raw Facts”

Computational science today is facing a credibility crisis: without
access to the data and computer code that underlies scientific
discoveries, published findings are all but impossible to verify (Donoho
et al. 2009). This chapter discusses how Intellectual Property Law
applies to data in the context of communicating scientific research.
Drawing on our vignette introduced in the beginning of Section 1, data
is understood as integral in the communication of scientific findings.
Data can refer to an input into scientific analysis, such as a publicly
available dataset like those at [Data.gov](https://explore.data.gov) or one gathered by researchers in the
course of the research, or it can refer to the output of computational
research. In short, it is typically an array of numbers or descriptions,
to which analysis an interpretation is applied.

In 2004, Gentleman and Temple Lang (Gentleman & Temple Lang 2004).
introduced the concept of the *compendium*: a novel way of disseminating
research results that expands the notion of the scientific publication
to include the data and software tools required to reproduce the
findings. At core, the research compendium envisions computational
results not in isolation, but as components in a description of a
meaningful scientific discovery.

Reproducible computational science has attracted attention since
Stanford Professor Jon Claerbout wrote some of the first really
reproducible manuscripts in 1992.[^11] Since then a number of
researchers have adopted reproducible methods (Donoho & Buckheit 1995;
Donoho et al. 2007; Stodden et al. 2012) or introduced them in their
role as journal editors[^12] (Trivers 2012). Mature responses to the
ubiquity of error in research have evolved for both branches of the
scientific method: the deductive branch relies on formal logic and
mathematical proof while the empirical branch has standards of
statistical hypothesis testing and standardized communication of
reproducibility information in the methods section. Unifying the
scholarly record to include digital objects such as code and data with
the published article facilitates the new types of information flows
necessary to establish verifiability and reproducibility in
computational science.

As we saw in the previous section, copyright attaches to the original
expression of ideas and not to the ideas themselves. In the case of
data, U.S. copyright does not attach to raw facts.[^13] In 1991 the U.S.
Supreme Court held that raw facts are not copyrightable but the original
“selection and arrangement” of these raw facts may be.[^14] The Supreme
Court has not ruled on Intellectual Property in data since and it seems
plausible that in modern scientific research the original selection and
arrangement of facts may create a residual copyright in a particular
dataset, if there was “original selection and arrangement” of these raw
facts. Collecting, cleaning, and readying data for analysis is often a
significant part of scientific research.

The *Reproducible Research Standard* (Stodden 2009a; Stodden 2009b)
recommends releasing data under a Creative Commons public domain
certification (CC0) in part because of the possibility of such a
residual copyright existing in the dataset.[^15] Public domain
certification means that as the dataset author you will not exercise any
rights you may have in the dataset that drive from copyright (or any
other ownership rights). A public domain certification also means that
as the author you are relying on downstream users’ ethics, rather than
legal devices, to cite and attribute your work appropriately.

Datasets may, of course, have barriers to re-use and sharing that do not
stem from Intellectual Property Law, such as confidentiality of records,
privacy concerns, and proprietary interests from industry or other
external collaborators that may assert ownership over the data. Good
practice suggests planning for data release before beginning a research
collaboration, whether it might be with industrial partners who may
foresee different uses for the data than really reproducible research,
or with scientists subject to a different Intellectual Property
framework for data, such as those in Europe (Stodden 2011).

## Research Dissemination: Methods / Code / Tools

Computational results are often of a complexity that makes communicating
the steps taken to arrive at a finding prohibitive in a typical
scientific publication, giving a key reason for releasing the code that
contains the steps and instructions that generated the published
findings. Of the three digital scholarly objects discussed in this
chapter, code has the most complex interactions with Intellectual
Property Law as it is both subject to copyright and patent law.

Software is subject to copyright, as it is an original expression of an
underlying idea. The algorithm or method that the code implements is not
subject to copyright, but copyright adheres to the actual sequence of
letters and numbers that is the code. Copyright prohibits others from
reproducing or modifying the code—for scientific applications this would
prohibit running the code on a different system (reproducing) or
adapting the code to a new problem (re-using). These action are openly
encouraged in scientific research and again, scientific norms are at
odds with Intellectual Property Law. An open license that permits others
to re-use your code is essential.

The Creative Commons licenses discussed in the previous section were
created for digital artistic works and they are not suitable for code.
There are, however, a great number of open licenses written for
software. Each of these licenses sets some specific terms of use for the
software (none of them rescind the underlying copyright). Software can
exist in two forms, source and compiled, and for modification
transmission of the compiled form alone is not sufficient. In the
context of scientific research, source code is often in the form of
scripts, Python or R for example, that execute in association with an
installed package and are not compiled. Communication of the source
code, whether intended to be compiled or not, is essential to
understanding and re-using scientific code.

There are several open licenses for code that place few restrictions on
use beyond attribution, creating the closest Intellectual Property
framework to conventional scientific norms. The (Modified) Berkeley
Software Distribution (BSD) license permits the downstream use, copying,
and distribution of either unmodified or modified source code, as long
as the license accompanies any distributed code and the previous
authors’ names are not used to promote any modified downstream software.
The license is brief enough it can be included here:

```
Copyright (c) \<YEAR\>, \<OWNER\>

All rights reserved.
```

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are
met:

* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
  notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
  notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the
  documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
* Neither the name of the \<ORGANIZATION\> nor the names of its
  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
  this software without specific prior written permission.

This template is followed by a disclaimer releasing the author from
liability for use of the code. The above copyright notice and list of
conditions, including the disclaimer, must accompany derivative works.
The Modified BSD license is very similar to the MIT license, with the
exception that the MIT license does not include a clause forbidding
endorsement. The Apache 2.0 license is also commonly used to specify
terms of use on software. Like the Modified BSD and MIT licenses, the
Apache license requires attribution. It differs from the previously
discussed licenses in that it permits users the exercise of patent
rights that would otherwise only extend to the original author, so that
a patent license is granted for any patents needed for use of the code.
The license does further stipulate that the right to use the software
without patent infringement will be lost if the downstream user of the
code sues the licensor for patent infringement. Attribution under Apache
2.0 requires that any modified code carries a copy of the license, with
notice of any modified files and all copyright, trademark, and patent
notices that pertain to the work must be included. Attribution can also
be done in the notice file.

The *Reproducible Research Standard* (Stodden 2009a; Stodden 2009b)
recommends using one of these three licenses, Modified BSD, MIT, or
Apache, for scripts and software released as part of a scientific
research compendium, or a similar open license whose only restriction on
reuse is attribution.

Patents are a second form of intellectual property that can be a barrier
to the open sharing of scientific codes. For example, as noted of the
University of British Columbia’s website,

*Members of faculty or staff, students and anyone connected with the
University are encouraged to discuss and publish the results of research
as soon and as fully as may be reasonable and possible. However,
publication of the details of an invention may make it impossible to
seek patent protection.*[^16]

Publication is, of course, the primary way research findings are made
available, and authors who seek patents may be less likely to openly
release their software, as software is a patentable entity (Stodden
2011). As university technology transfer offices encourage startups
based about patentable technology and software, the incentives to
release code that permits others to replicate published findings
decreases. These two systems, technology transfer through patents and
scientific integrity through openly available software, can co-exist. A
dual-licensing system, for example, can be introduced that enables
patent revenues for commercial downstream use, while permitting open
access for research use like verification of findings and re-use of code
for research application (Stodden & Reich 2011).

It should be made clear that the code and scripts alone are not
generally sufficient to ensure reproducible research, nor to understand
the scientific findings in question. The accompanying narrative,
documentation, and meta-data are an essential part of understanding the
research findings and for their verification and replication.

## Conclusion

The current set of scientific norms evolved to maximize the integrity of
our stock of scientific knowledge. Hence they espouse independent
verification and transparency, and historically this has been part of
the rationale for the publication of research findings. The complexity
of modern computational science means that in order to make
reproducibility possible new types of scholarly objects, data and code,
must be communicated. In this chapter I have traced how Intellectual
Property Law creates barriers to scholarly communication, through both
the copyright and patent systems.

For broad reuse, sharing, and archiving of code to be a possibility, it
is important that open licenses be used that minimize encumbrances to
access and reuse, such as attribution only licenses like the MIT license
or the Modified BSD license. A collection of code with an attribution
only licensing structure, or public domain certification, permits
archiving, persistence of the code, and research on the code base
itself. Similarly for collections of research articles. The current
system of distributed permission-based ownership makes archiving,
research extensions, and scholarly research on publications next to
impossible. For these reasons, as well as the integrity of our body of
scholarly knowledge, it is imperative to address the barriers created by
current Intellectual Property Law in such a way that access, reuse, and
future research are promoted and preserved.
